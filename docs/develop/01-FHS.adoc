| /boot                       | Boot required files including kernel and initramfs
| /packages                   | User packages
| /system                     | Inmutable system folder

The previous folders can be splitted in multiple packages. Such as <pkg>-client, <pkg>-common, <pkg>-server, <pkg>-src, etc...
